# GOOGLE_APPS

Problem Statement:
With the continuous influx of apps in the Play Store, predicting an app's success is crucial for developers. This project aims to explore and preprocess a dataset of 10k Play Store apps to lay the foundation for future predictive analytics. By addressing issues like duplicates, missing values, and outliers, we strive to enhance the dataset for accurate modeling. Additionally, the creation of a 'Rating_category' feature and encoding categorical columns will facilitate the analysis of factors contributing to an app's success.

Objective:

Import and explore the dataset, addressing data quality issues.
Create meaningful features like 'Rating_category' for predictive analytics.
Standardize and encode data for effective modeling.
Split the dataset for training and testing machine learning models.
Conclusion:
Through rigorous data preprocessing, including handling duplicates, missing values, and outliers, we have refined the dataset for predictive analytics. The creation of a 'Rating_category' feature allows us to categorize ratings, providing a clearer understanding of app success factors. By standardizing and encoding the data, we've prepared it for machine learning models. Moving forward, this processed dataset can be utilized for predictive analytics studies to assist developers in making informed decisions about their app features and, consequently, increase their chances of success in the competitive Play Store environment.
